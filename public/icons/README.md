# PWA Icons

This directory contains Progressive Web App icons. In a production environment, you would need to create actual PNG icon files with the following dimensions:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png  
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

For now, placeholder files can be created or you can use a tool like PWA Builder to generate these icons from a single source image.

You can use online tools like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/

The icons should represent the FRA Portal branding and be easily recognizable on mobile devices.
